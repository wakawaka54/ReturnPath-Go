## Building this Repo

**`ReturnPath-Go`** is made up of two Go packages, **`rpfrontend`** and **`rpapi`**. In order to launch both of these packages, I have facilated a **docker-compose** file which should make it very easy to launch both of these.

1. Make sure you have `docker-compose` and `docker` installed on your machine (don't want to use docker? See below!)
2. Clone the repo using **`git clone https://github.com/wakawaka54/ReturnPath-Go.git`**
3. Enter into the repo **`cd ReturnPath-Go`**
4. Run **`docker-compose build`**
  * This should build both images, depending on how you have `docker-compose` configured, you may need to run this as sudo
5. Run **`docker-compose up`**
  * This should start up both images
6. The frontend should be mapped to **`http://localhost:1400`**
7. The backend should be mapped to **`http://localhost:1337`**

### What if I don't want to use Docker?

Well, you don't have to use Docker! :ok_woman:

1. You will need one of the latest versions of Go. I used `go1.7` for this particular project.
2. Find the **`src/`** folder that goes along with your installation of `Go`. If you don't know what I am talking about, [Go](https://golang.org/doc/install) follow the guide. No pun intended.
3. You can **`git clone https://github.com/wakawaka54/ReturnPath-Go.git`** directly into the **/src** folder
4. **`cd ReturnPath-Go.git`** then **`cd rpapi`** to get into the **rpapi** directory.
5. Run **`go get`** to fetch all the dependencies and use **`go install`** to generate the binary into the **/bin** folder of your **Go** installation
6. You can now **`rpapi`** to run the binary if you have your **$PATH** variable modified to include the **/bin** folder
  * If you don't run `rpapi` from inside the **rpapi** directory, you will get some configuration errors. You can fix these by setting the **rpapi** directory path to the `GO_HOME` environment variable
7. You can now **`cd ..`** and **`cd rpfrontend`** and use **`go get`** to fetch all the dependencies and **`go install`** to generate the binary
8. Again, if you have the **$PATH** variable modified correctly, you should be able to run **`rpfrontend`** to begin the frontend.
 * If you don't see any data showing up, this is probably because the port mappings are changed on your machine. Set the `ApiAddress` in `config.json` in the **rpfrontend** directory to the correct **rpapi** address on your machine.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;**`409`** - Conflict - Issue parsing request JSON data

#### DELETE `/api/sentences/{id}`
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Deletes a sentence object in the database

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;**Example Url:** `/api/sentences/8520`

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;**Status Codes**

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;**`202`** - Accepted - Sentence was deleted

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;**`404`** - Not Found - Sentence with ID was not found

#### GET `/api/sentences/statistics`
